MicroJava Compiler
==================

About MicroJava
---------------

MicroJava is a simple language made by H. Mössenböck for a Compiler Construction
course.  It is not the same as Java Micro Edition (JavaME) used on mobile
phones.

More about the course, the language and its VM:

The site for the Serbian version of the course:

About the compiler and runner
-----------------------------

The source files for a functional MJ compiler are given in the compiler-src
folder.  These are heavily based on the source templates that are used in
the Compiler Construction classes and finished by students during the
course. 

The original source templates were written by Moessenboeck and are available
on the sites given above, though there are posible updates.  The version
given has the compiler finished by a student, and a few additional changes
(such as the optional decoding while writeing to file).


Usage
-----

An ant build script can be found in the root folder of the project and it
includes (among others) tasks for building the sources, as well as using
the compiler and runner. 

Otherwise calls can be made with:

java MJ.Compiler <input.mj> [-print]
java MJ.Run [-d] <input.obj>

There is also a Decoder available:

java MJ.Decode <input.obj>

You might want to include the "compiler-bin" into your CLASSPATH, or just
use "-cp compiler-bin" in the command line.
